# LeetCode problems, but cleaner!

## Background: 

I personally do not believe LeetCode or textbook algorithmic problems reflect the ability to write production code, therefore I have decided to create this repository, which keeps readability in mind. Some pointers I plan to follow are: 

- Avoiding code obfuscation or one liner solutions. 
- Modularizing sub-blocks in a logic.
- Properly type-casting variables and avoiding implicit casting by the compilers whenever possible. 
- (This is not done in production) But, I am going to maybe be a little explicit about the solutions and the thought process in my solutions. At times, I may attach a custom README markdown for specific problems. 

## Why am I doing this? 

Most LeetCode editorials promote 1-liner solutions, and there seems to be some weird 'competition' on how to make your code shorter. I personally do not like LeetCode promoting abysmal coding practices, and I will *try* to write code that reads a little smoother, as in the real industry, readability > showing the person reading the code that you know extra language specific tricks and shortcuts.

## Guidelines: 

Each problem might have multiple solutions, and I will probably go with the format of `1.cpp`, `2.cpp`, etc, in an incremental fashion from 1 to N, where 1 refers to the worst asymptotic performance, and N refers to the best asymptotic performance.
